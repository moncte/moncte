## 🚫 Python is not programming

I hate Python.
Not “I don’t like it” - I mean I genuinely hate it.

The shit-slinging manipulation they teach in Python courses is horrifying and has nothing to do with serious software engineering. People are sold an illusion of complexity, where “engineering” is reduced to importing libraries and mindlessly repeating tutorials. No depth, no understanding-just a bag of tricks for trained monkeys.

Programming is about technology. About difficult things. About how systems actually work not memorizing APIs and copy-pasting from Stack Overflow. It’s about architecture, protocols, memory, concurrency, and the hard limits of hardware and networks. Everything else is just servicing other people’s solutions without understanding the consequences.

Python hides the truth behind abstractions and it does it aggressively. JavaScript does the same: ninety percent of the code is library calls smeared with syntactic sugar. You’re not writing a program; you’re yanking someone else’s functions and hoping the library author was smarter than you.

Python lets you send HTTP requests without knowing what HTTP is. It lets you spin up TCP servers with no understanding of TCP/IP. It lets you “write asynchronous code” without understanding how the event loop works or what’s happening under the hood. All of this is marketed as convenience, but in reality it’s just a way to conceal ignorance.

The result is people who call themselves programmers yet have no idea where latency comes from, why a service collapses under load, or what actually happens between a request and a response. For them, the system is a black box, and any problem is “solved” by adding another library or another hack.

And that’s sad. Because Python doesn’t just simplify it trains people not to think. It builds a culture where not knowing is normal, and trying to understand is seen as unnecessary. The outcome isn’t engineering; it’s a simulation of work-code exists, but comprehension doesn’t.

If you’re genuinely interested in programming not playing at being a programmer - Python is a dead end. It creates an illusion of control in places where control has long since disappeared.
